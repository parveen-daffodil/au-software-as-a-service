## Exclusivity

### Service is not exclusive

Contractor's supply of Service to Customer is not exclusive. Contractor may engage in a similar Agreement to supply Service to other parties.

PATXXX: I don't really think we want to have an exclusivity option. It's so rare that I'm content to leave it up to free draft.


##Availability

Software as a service can be subject to technical interuptions. This topic addresses how acceptable interruptions to the Service are to the Customer. Generally, the second option is only reasonable when the Service is absolutely essential to the Customer, and when the Service is expensive.

### Reasonable availability of Service

- Reasonable effort to ensure service is available during normal business hours (this is pretty soft in my opinion. May want a spectrum of options for this.)
- Service occasionaly unavailable for reasons of maintainance/development/force majure
- Some features of the Service may rely of third party service providers. Unless otherwise mentioned in the agreement, Contractor does not promise that these features will always be available.

### Interruptions to the Service are strictly limited

PATXXX: You will need to make sure that the contractor is only accepting responsibility for stuff that is under their control here - it's tricky. Talk to me.

Contractor promises that technical interruptions to the Service due to the Contractor will be limited to no more than {{permitted interuption time}} per {{interuption term}}

## Data Rights

### Data Obligations

- International Storage of Data - do we just say that Customer grants Contractor the right to store data internationally?

- Data remains property of Customer. Customer grants contractor a license to do anything with the data it needs to in order to meet it's obligations under the agreement

- PAT: Do we actually just use the license module for the above?

- Customer indemnifies Contractor against any claim by any third party that the Data infringes on the rights of that third party (IP rights, privacy rights, etc, etc)


- PATXXX: Yes, the above item should be handled by the indemnity module. Once we have the ability to ovveride the default guidance I'll implement the above. Or is the above handled by the language in the posted information module?

## Backups

The Customer may want the Contractor to ensure that their Data is backed up in multiple locations or formats. However, this may lie outside the scope of the Service offered by Contractor.

### Contractor does not back up Data for the customer

Contractor does not offer backups of Data as a component of the Service. Responsibility for Data loss lies with the Customer.

### Contractor does back up Data

Contractor performs backups of Data every {{backup period}}. Contractor does not accept responsibility for data loss that occurs between these backups.

## Warranties
### Contractor warrants they possess neccesary IP rights

PATXXX - This is to serve the same purpose as the indemity we talked about. Skips two indemnities in the document.

Contractor promises that it posseses all third party intellectual property rights neccesary to supply the Service to the Customer.

Warranties are limited to those explicitly described in the agreement. No implied warrenties exist including fitness for a particular purpose.
